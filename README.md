## Layered Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture pattern, which separates the concerns of different components and promotes modularity and testability. The project consists of the following layers:

- GUI layer: This layer is responsible for rendering the graphical user interface using Pygame and handling the user input. 

- Game logic layer: This layer is responsible for implementing the core logic of the game, such as checking the board state, validating the moves, and determining the winner. It also contains the classes that represent the computer players and their strategies.
